## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>
 The following function signatures are exported by the os_io.h library:
```C
SO_FILE *so_fopen(const char *pathname, const char *mode);
int so_fclose(SO_FILE *stream);
int so_fileno(SO_FILE *stream);
int so_fflush(SO_FILE *stream);
int so_fputc(int c, SO_FILE *stream);
size_t so_fread(void *ptr, size_t size, size_t nmemb, SO_FILE *stream);
size_t so_fwrite(const void *ptr, size_t size, size_t nmemb, SO_FILE *stream);
int so_fseek(SO_FILE *stream, long offset, int whence);
long so_ftell(SO_FILE *stream);
```
To use this functions you must add the os_io.h header in your source and specify at compile time where the library can be found
## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites
To use the os_io.h library on your projects you must have:

* for UNIX based operating systems:
  * gcc - is a tool from the GNU Compiler Collection used to compile and link C programs

### Installing
This is a step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.

* Linux:
  * start by updating the packages list
    ```bash
    $sudo apt update
    ```
  * install the build-essential package(a package of new packages including gcc, g++ and make) by typing:
    ```bash
    $sudo apt install build-essential 
    ```
